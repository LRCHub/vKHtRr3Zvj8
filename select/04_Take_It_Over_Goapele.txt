Can we speak honestly?
I feel it vividly
I know you know
Don't leave me out here alone

'Cause everything you're telling me
And everything you're showing me
I'm right where you want me

Take it over
Take me over
Bring it over
Take it over
You got that lovin'
Everything I want
Win me over
Take it over

You might be what I've been waiting on
It's your time
Give me a reason to play along
You've been watching
I was just living
Living and moving you know
Now I'm just spinning
I've never been here before
