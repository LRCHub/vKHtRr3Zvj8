I been Spitting since eleven but I
Never had a beat like this
Envision heaven but I never thought
It be like this
Young Vic the reverend prolly never
Had a feat like this
No second guessing now I'm sticking
With the seat I picked now listen in
Cuz I don’t mean to flex but
God just broke my chains kept my diamonds
And necklace bruh I'm free to go
Ripping shows out of Texas yuh
Mama worried i won't make it I’m
Just waitin on the check trust
King like David so no fear
And the feeling's right
Slingshotted my career y'all
Just some philistines illest mind
Yeah, like the one from the NY
Contemplated quitting but then wondered
Why end? I
Say, what I'm thinking I can't sensor myself
I had to throw money out to
Make some sense of myself
I self loathe, I self hate I self love, I'm
Self grown I'm self made I'm stufficient
I’m about to take it over
A lot of me im sharing out a lot of me
In class, I was like tariffs
And failing the economy
I take you where the bottom be
I show you where my God Dennis Rodman me
And block me for the bull but we cool now
Throw it back to them old days
When I clean pool house
I ain’t like it but i def
Ain't got no pool now
Yeah, taken for granted but now I
Take it and plan it
Refuse to take it to cities
I’d rather take it to planets
I'm on my Aiken I'm branded
I'm trojan horses these randoms
I got the force man I’m phantom I'm
Bout it bout it bout bout
Yo, take it all from the source
I've only had 3 projects it's
Bout time for the 4th this the sophomore
Up in my sleeve I got more
Verses on they way up like
Some certain car doors
Ardmore, spent the year way out in Ada
I say peace be to you haters then I tell
Em see you later bout to take it over
